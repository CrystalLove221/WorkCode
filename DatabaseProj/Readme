Files:
--root: jdbc libraries, jar executable, all source class files
--trh221: project source code
--incomplete: code I wanted to implement
--sql_sheet: sql worksheets used for autogenerating relations and testing database queries
--data_insert: data generator program for almost entire database
	(does not include shipments, purchases, nor recalls)

Database:
--every product is a commodity (no proprietary supplier)
--Each supplier can make multiple products
--Every shipment consists of only one product from one group
--Suppliers have infinite budget on purchases and never run out of stock on products
--every group of products is made of the same product (another product group)
--Unfortunately, none of the mandatory participation constraints from ER diagram
	work in the database
--A factory without a supplier is not a factory
	(deleted from database if supplier is shutdown)

Interfaces:
--log in with Oracle username and password
--Supply of product for a supplier is the quantity of a group of product held by that supplier
--User may choose to cancel return a product or cancel a purchase.
	Cancelled purchases remove associated shipment from database

--At any point where a single character input is not requested,
	the user may cancel an update by supplying a blank.
	(note: for addresses, a blank on street, city, and state is required for cancel)


Disclaimer: Any unnerving text output is a joke. I had to make coding fun somehow.
